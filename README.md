# Bellatrix App

This is the Bellatrix game. Enjoy!

## Guidelines

- All logic goes to Hooks
- Automated tests should test Actions/Logic (hooks) and effects on UI. For example: The HP bar should go lower and monster.hp should go lower as well

## Main configurations

- React.js 18+ with TypeScript;
  - You can import "svgs" with `import { ReactComponent as MyIcon } from './icon-path.svg'`;
  - You can import any other media (images, videos, etc) that is located inside `src` directory;
  - You can use absolute imports, using `@` as `src` directory;
- Eslint:
  - [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) with some modifications;
  - React Hooks and other React configurations with [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app) (same used in Create React App);
- Automatic lint and type-checking with Husky before every commit.

## Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Run dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

You can run type-checking in watch mode in another terminal, if you may:

```sh
yarn type-check --watch
```

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

## Production version

To generate the production version, you can run:

```sh
yarn build
```

All files you have to deploy will be located at the `dist` directory.

### Run production version locally

To check if everything will be ok in production before the deployment, you can run this command after `yarn build`:

```sh
yarn preview
```

## Tech Debt

1. Fix Linter on startup
2. Fix Linter on commit messages
